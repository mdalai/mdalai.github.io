		<h3> Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Projects </h3>	
		<p> Jan 2018 - Nov 2018 [<a href="https://graduation.udacity.com/nd801">certificate</a>] </p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>  TrackVan Capstone Project: </b>
				This app is designed for van owners for tracking its usage within different drivers. 
				For example, in a high school, the principal can be the owner of the van and use this app 
				to track and manage the van's usage. The van can be shared between football team, soccer team, 
				basketball team and international center.
				List the main features of your app: 
				  user authentication with sign in and sign out functinalities; 
				  van admin - create, update, delete van; share van unique code to users by email or msg; 
				  user - include, disclude van; to use a van, has to include it first; 
				  users can do view van status, start using van, return van. 

				Data persistence is accomplished by Firebase user authentication and Firebase realtime database.

			<li><b> Gradle for Android and Java Final Project: </b> 
				In this project, I created an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and 
				Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist of four modules. 
				A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes, 
				an Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes, 
				and an Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to 
				the Android Library for display.

			<li><b>XYZ Reader App project: </b> 
				Completed a content reading app per the starter code provided.
			    [<a href = "https://github.com/mdalai/xyz-reader">github</a>]</li>
			<li><b>Android Baking App project: </b> 
				Created an app to view video recipes that incorporated media loading, verifying user interfaces with UI tests, 
				integrated third party libraries and provided a complete UX with home screen widget. 
				Following features are accomplished: 
				 used MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos;
				 handled error cases in Android.
				 added a widget to the app experience.
				 leveraged a third-party library in the app.
				 used Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
			    [<a href = "https://github.com/mdalai/baking-app">github</a>]</li>
			<li><b> Popular Movies Android App: </b> 
				Built an Android app to help users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web.
				This app utilizes core Android user interface components and fetches movie information using themoviedb.org web API.
				The app displays a scrolling grid of movie trailers and launches a details screen whenever a particular movie is selected. 
				Allows users to save favorites, play trailers, and read user reviews.
				In addition, it is optimized for tablet users.			
			    [<a href = "https://github.com/mdalai/popular-movies-app">github</a>]</li>
			<li><b> Sandwich Club Project:</b>
				In this project, I completed the Sandwich Club app to show the details of each sandwich once it is selected. 
				Built a ScrollView layout, populated its fields by parsing JSON data recieved. 
				Utilized Android image downloading and caching library Picasso.
